                    <p>Apart from being a seasoned veteran in the kitchen I am a huge tech head. I am always trying to stay up to date with the newest concepts in the tech industry and anything science related for that matter. I enjoy learning about topics ranging from cryptocurrencies, to new advances in nuclear fussion or concepts such as Bayes' theorem or the survivor bias. On top of tech I also find finances incredibly exciting. Following the markets may be a chore for some but for me it's a way to both enjoy my time and find monetary success.</p>
                    <p>Of course I'm not always studying, even if I do genuinely enjoy it. You can find me playing video games, testing out new recipes, cooking for friends, and just about anything outdoors from a simple walk to playing frisbee or taking a trip to the beach. And as much as it may seem less of a hobby and more of a requirement for human existence I am very extroverted. So seeing friends and family is always a great way to spend my time often leading to me teaching them about something new I learned recently.</p>
